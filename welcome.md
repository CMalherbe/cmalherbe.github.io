I am a currently working as an **Entrepreneur in Residence** at Minist√®re de la Justice, Paris. I hold a Ph.D. in machine learning, prepared at ENS Paris-Saclay, from 2014 to 2017.

I am currently working in Natural Language Processing applied to legal documents.

My Ph.D. was obtained under the supervision of [Nicolas Vayatis](http://example.com). I developed new stochastic algorithms and methods for hyper-parameter optimization.

My detailed resume can be found here. More details on my research and on software.
